# Exercise 21 - Geolocation

Geolocation

## About this exercise ...

Had to do a bit of configuration to get this going, but ended up getting the result.

I don't think Parcel JS does the certificate for https ... I ended up running the build then using the
package.json from build folder.

I've done a bit on geolocation before but not speed/heading.

## Tooling

Serve:

`npm run exercise-21`

Build:

`npm build exercise-21`
