# Exercise 30 - Countdown Timer

Create a Whack-A-Mole Game.

## About this exercise ...

Fun way to finish the 30 day challenge!! I'll add some thoughts to the main
README.

:gem: Event.isTrusted
:gem: Recursion

#### Event is trusted

I didn't know about this property on the Event object. It is boolean based on whether the event was generated by a user action. From MDN:

```
const bool = event.isTrusted;
```

It was used to discover cheats in the game! :rage:


#### Recursion

This task introduced recursion. From MDN:

> Recursion â€” An act of a function calling itself

I am familiar with the technique, but it's not always the one that is front of mind when solving problems ...

*but* ... and why I have enjoyed this challenge - I did this task this morning, then used recursion in code today for work in a situation where I may not have before! :fire:

The example from this task:

```
protected _peep(): void {
	...
	setTimeout(() => {
		...
		if (!this._timeUp) {
			this._peep();
		} else {
			this._gameOver();
		}
	}, time);
}
```
