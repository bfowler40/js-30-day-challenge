# Javascript 30 Day Challenge

##### 30 basic JS challenges from Wes Bos

[Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/)

This is a beginner/intermediate challenge to complete 30 basic javascript exercises, one per day for 30 days. :date:

I am planning to build on this by using Typescript and ES6 features and to apply my own coding style. :metal:

I may not learn a lot from the challenges per se, but I aim to dive a bit deeper into each exercise and hopefully begin a routine of building upon my knowledge outside of employment. :muscle:

While I don't really set New Year's Resolutions (or keep them) this challenge can at least be seen as a new year, new start thing ... I will enjoy the discipline of doing something every day and ... it could be fun. :fire: :fire:
