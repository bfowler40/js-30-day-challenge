# Exercise 03 - Update CSS Variables

An exercise to demonstrate CSS custom properties and how these variables can be modified using JS.

Tested in Chrome.

## About this exercise ..

This was a quick exercise and one that I may come back to later to build something cooler. For now it simply allows the user to create a simple gradient using colors selected from the HTML Input.

#### HTMLInputElement

Another new type today is the HTMLInputElement. It was used in the exercise to signal that my object had a value property. :wolf:
