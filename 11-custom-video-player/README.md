## About this exercise ...

This was an interesting exercise. Mainly consisted of adding a lot of event listeners ...

I followed quite closely to the solution on this exercise.

No comments for this exercise.

It might be an idea to use this as some sort of UX example, so I didn't do too much to the style
other than use some of the solution css, and i'll come back to it later.
