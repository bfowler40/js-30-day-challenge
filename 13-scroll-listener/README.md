# Exercise 13 - Scroll Event Listener

Update DOM elements based on scroll position.

## About this exercise ...

I have done written similar functions many times, especially for things like sticky
elements. Therefore I didn't gain much from the exercise ...

However ... implementing a debounce module with a callback to a class method that
calls an array method on a class property ... was quite tricky!!! :disappointed_relieved:

I ran out of time so will have a think about this and come back to it. I event want to make a Gist of the solution
