# Exercise 01 - Drum Kit

## About this exercise ..

Okay, interesting ... like i'd hoped there were a few takeaways from this exercise.

:gem: Typings <br/>
:gem: The JS Promise API <br/>
:gem: Git on CL (... and Emoji!)

#### Typings

Made an effort not to use 'any' here and was led to extend the Event and Element interfaces, which was new. :smiley_cat:

#### JS Promise API

Used the AngularJS $q service a lot but first time using the API. As a caveat there is no browser fallback here and i'm not too concerned at this point about handling a rejection. :snowboarder:

#### Git

We use a GUI for source control at work. I have github desktop on this mac. However, I realised that I hadn't ever used git solely on the command line before ... and so that's what i'm doing. Also, i'm guaranteed to over-do it with Emoji lol. :blush:
