# Exercise 24 - Sticky Nav

Add a scroll listener and create a sticky element

## About this exercise ...

:confused:

This exercise was a bit disappointing unfortunately. We have already done a scroll
listener exercise and this solution is a bit barebones without a debounce.

I'll take the short exercise today though ...

## Tooling

Serve:

`npm run exercise-24`

Build:

`npm build exercise-24`
